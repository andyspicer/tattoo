# Tatt-E - Tattoo Recognition Technology - Evaluation

Tatt-E is being initiated by NIST to assess and measure the capability of systems to perform automated image-based tattoo recognition.  The evaluation seeks to assess comparative and absolute accuracy, along with run-time performance on large, operationally realistic datasets. Tatt-E will be focused on, but not limited to, the following primary operational use cases:
- Tattoo Identification - matching different instances of the same tattoo image from the same subject over time.
- Region of Interest - matching a small sub region of interest that is contained in a larger image.
- Tattoo detection/localization – determining whether an image contains a tattoo and if so, segmentation of the tattoo.
- Sketches – matching sketches to tattoos.

**Participation**:  Interested developers and organizations need to follow the instructions detailed in the [Tatt-E Concept, Evaluation Plan, and API document](https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2016/12/01/tatt-e_api.pdf) to participate in the test.  The final version of the document, and its C++ interface header are now online. Implementers should conform to this API and submit algorithms to NIST following the schedule published on the Tatt-E website.
