# Tatt-E - Tattoo Recognition Technology - Evaluation

Tatt-E is being initiated by NIST to assess and measure the capability of systems to perform automated image-based tattoo recognition.  The evaluation seeks to assess comparative and absolute accuracy, along with run-time performance on large, operationally realistic datasets. Tatt-E will be focused on, but not limited to, the following primary operational use cases:
- Tattoo Identification - matching different instances of the same tattoo image from the same subject over time.
- Region of Interest - matching a small sub region of interest that is contained in a larger image.
- Tattoo detection/localization – determining whether an image contains a tattoo and if so, segmentation of the tattoo.
- Sketches – matching sketches to tattoos.
